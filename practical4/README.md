## Practical 4

exercise4.c creates an array of the values of tan(x) where x varies from 0 degrees to 60 degrees in steps of 5 degrees.

This is done by defining a function degtorad which converts an angle in degrees to an angle in radians.

It then uses the trapezoid rule to integrate as in practical 3.

As exercise4.c uses the math library, -lm must be used when compiling it.
