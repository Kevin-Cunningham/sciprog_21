#Practical 9
##makeMatrix.c
For this practical the makeMatrix.c script creates matrices and saves them in a file in a format that can be read for the next part of the practical.

This script will ask for the name you want to save the matrix under. DO NOT INCLUDE an extension. This is done automatically.

You are asked for the size of the square matrix you want to make, then for each element row by row and column by column. 

Using the makeMatrix.c script is the easiest way to make sure matrix files can be read by main.c .
##main.c
main.c then asks for the name of the file in which the matrix you want to check resides. It will print off the matrix so you can check that it is the correct one, and a message is printed declaring the matrix to be magic or not.
